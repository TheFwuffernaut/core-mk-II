        "description": "On a hit, the user may choose to pull their target 1 spaces in a straight line directly towards the point of origin (e.g., the attacking mech or the center of a Blast). Multiple Pull effects stack with each other. This means that an attack made with a Pull 1 weapon and a talent that grants Pull 1 counts as having Pull 2. Pull and Knockback may be used to cancel out each other."
