When itâ€™s reduced to 0 HP and 0 Structure, it is not destroyed: instead, you must make a structure damage check each time it takes damage. While in this state, your mech cannot regain HP until you rest or perform a Full Repair, at which point your mech can be repaired normally. You may increase the final value of one d6 on your Structure check by 1."
